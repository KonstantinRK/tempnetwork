\title{A function that checks, if the object assigned to the tempflow-field 'graph',
\itemize{
  \item is an 'igraph'-object;
  \item is a directed and acyclic;
  \item contains no duplicate edges;
  \item has unique vertex names (of type string);
  \item whether the edge attribute "weight" takes on non-negative, numerical values for each edge in the graph.

\usage{
\method{check_graph_for_tempflow_completely}{tempflow}(tempFlow,
  throwError = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tempFlow}{A 'tempflow'-object.}

\item{throwError}{If TRUE, violating the criteria above will result in the throwing of an error. Otherwise, FALSE will be returned.}
}
\value{
The boolean value TRUE, if the criteria above are satisfied. Otherwise, FALSE or an exception will be returned.
