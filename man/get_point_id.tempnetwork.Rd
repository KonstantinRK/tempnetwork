\title{Given a point-name (or a point-id) this function returns the corresponding point-id
as defined in (the 'igraph'-object underlying) the 'tempflow'-object provided through the given 'tempnetwork'-object.
If the given point-name (or point-id) is not present and if 'safe' has the value TRUE, an error will be thrown.}
\usage{
\method{get_point_id}{tempnetwork}(tempNetwork, inpPoint, safe = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tempNetwork}{A 'tempnetwork'-object.}

\item{inpPoint}{Either a string representing the point-name or
an integers representing the point-id.}

\item{safe}{If TRUE, it will be tested, whether the given point-name (or point-id) is present in the 'tempflow'-object.}
}
\value{
The point-id of the point specified in "inpPoint", as currently defined in the 'tempflow'-object provided through the given 'tempnetwork'-object.
